I have spent nearly my entire life living in the same place and the same town.  Greenwood, Indiana is pretty average.  It has an equal mix of middle class and lower class with a few higher class families sprinkled on top. Greenwood, Indiana is smack dab in the middle of Indiana,  And Indiana is smack dab in the middle of the United States of America.  There is a stereotype about Indiana. We are known for our cornfields and our farmers and quite frankly, for being boring. Especially for those with the spirit of adventure imprinted into them, Indiana can be a tough place to settle. There are no beaches or mountains or big-name places nearby.  On the weekends my friends and I always struggle to keep ourselves out of the bottomless pit of boredom. I find myself repeating the phrase, “Indiana is so boring,” far too often. 


My time in this town however, is reaching its end.  In about 250 days I will be leaving for college.  Although my choice of education is ironically in Indiana, I will no longer be spending my time in Greenwood.  That’s great right?  Small town girl finally gets to leave her home and experience life from a new perspective.  That is great and I am more than ecstatic about my future but that chapter in my life starts 250 days from now.  That means this current chapter still has some pages left and there is nothing worse than a boring book.  


Thus, I have come up with an idea.  Every day to the best of my ability, I will be seeking after the beautiful things of Indiana and Greenwood.  Me and my camera will be making an effort everyday to bring out the best in this state and in this town.
